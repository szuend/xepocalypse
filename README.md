# Xepocalypse - Fight for the universe

A small mod that changes the starting universe to already be overrun with Xenon.
Only the Terran Protectorate is holding on. They shut down the gate from Neptun to Brennan's Triumph
and built a last line of defense in Getsu Fune, hoping against all hope that they can
re-take the universe and help re-settle the races that have sought refuge on the planets of Sol.

## Disclaimer

Xepocalypse is in early Beta. It only changes the starting universe and does (not yet) have any balancing changes.
As such it is highly likely that the whole scenario doesn't even work and Sol will be overrun after a couple
of hours of playtime without enough time for the player to get started.

## Major Changes

* Xenon own all sectors except all Sol sectors and Getsu Fune.
* Added a new custom gamestart: Start on PHQ in Mars with the "Terran Cadet" ship.
* Added a "Vault of the Keepers" station to Mars. It houses all the displaced faction representatives.

## Minor Changes

* Added some defensive platforms to Getsu Fune.
* Disabled the gate from Neptung to Brennan's Triumph.
* Each non-Sol sector has a Xenon Defense Platform at the start.
* Removed all other game starts. They would start in sectors owned by Xenon.
* The new custom game start setsmost factions to +20. This is to unlock blueprints and help rebuild.
* Bumped resources in Asteriod Belt, Saturn and Oorth Cloud to fuel the war machine.
* Remove terran prelude story cutscene (Teladi and Border pratol bickering)

## Mod Compatibility

To be honest, no idea. The mod is pretty aggressive with removing known stations from known sectors.
Personally, I have developed Xepocalypse with the following mods enabled:

  * VRO
  * deadairgate, deadairgod, deadairjobs, deadairware
  * Faction Enhancer - War Module

Mods that do the following may not work as intended:

  * Mods that add new sectors / factions. Xepocalypse will leave those alone as it does not know about them.

## Changelog

### v0.12

  * Adjust relationship between factions to be neutral (0) at the worst. This is to prevent factions fighting in the limited available space.

### v0.11

  * Add Commonwealth "Scrap Recylcer" module blueprint (with Terran building materials) to PIO. This allows bootstrapping of Hull Parts and Claytronics with nothing but scrap.
