# Xepocalypse - Refuge of humanity

A small mod that changes the starting universe to already be overrun with Xenon.
Only the Terran Protectorate is holding on. They shut down the gate from Neptun to Brennan's Triumph
and built a last line of defense in Getsu Fune, hoping against all hope that they can
re-take the universe and help re-settle the races that have sought refuge on the planets of Sol.

## Changes

* Xenon own all sectors except Sol and Getsu Fune.
* Each non-Sol sector has a Xenon Defense Platform at the start.
* Added some defensive platforms to Getsu Fune.
* Disabled the gate from Neptung to Brennan's Triumph.
